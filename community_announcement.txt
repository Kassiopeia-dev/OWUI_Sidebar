OWUI Sidebar Extension for Chrome/Edge(tested)/Brave - Community Release

Hello OWUI Community,

I've developed a Chrome extension that integrates Open WebUI into the browser's sidebar, providing convenient access to AI capabilities while browsing.

## Overview
The OWUI Sidebar Extension allows users to interact with Open WebUI through Chrome's side panel, enabling chat, content analysis, and knowledge management without switching tabs.

## Key Features

### Content Extraction
- Extracts actual page content rather than passing URLs only
- Ensures authenticated and private pages remain accessible to OWUI
- Handles PDFs and standard web pages; YouTube URLs are passed directly for native processing

### RAG Integration
- Upload documents to knowledge collections directly from the browser
- Select specific collections or use defaults
- Requires API key configuration

### Authentication Handling
The extension preserves authentication context by extracting visible content, addressing common issues with:
- Pages behind login walls
- Internal company resources  
- Content requiring specific session data


### Dual-URL System
- Automatically switches between internal (local) and external URLs
- Reduces latency by avoiding tunnel routing (Tailscale/Cloudflare) when on local networks
- Visual indicators display active connection status (green for internal, yellow for external)

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Chrome's sidePanel API for integration
- Content extraction via content scripts
- Maintains session context through iframe embedding

## Installation
1. Download the extension files
2. Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
3. Load as unpacked extension
4. Configure OWUI URLs in extension settings
5. Add API key for knowledge features

## Use Cases
- Research and documentation review
- Content summarization
- Knowledge base building
- General browsing with AI assistance

## Known Limitations
- TTS/STT features not supported due to browser audio restrictions
- Some websites may prevent content extraction

## Open Source
The code is freely available for developers to use, modify, or build upon as needed. Feel free to:
- Fork and customize for your specific needs
- Contribute improvements
- Use components in your own projects
- Add appropriate license information as required for your use case

The extension is provided as-is without warranty. Users and developers should add their preferred license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.) when distributing modified versions.

## Feedback
Issues, suggestions, and contributions are welcome. The extension has been tested with various OWUI deployments but may require adjustments for specific configurations.
